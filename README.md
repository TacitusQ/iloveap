Git is Awesome!

To see how forks, pull requests, and merges work with github:

  - `fork` this repo (there's a button in the upper right!).
  - Clone your fork to a local computer, so you can work on it.
  - Add the upstream repository: `git remote add upstream git@github.com:cs3157/iloveap.git`
  - Fetch any changes since you forked: `git fetch upstream`
  - Merge the changes, if necessary: `git merge upstream/master`
  - Add your name to the list of aweome APers.
  - Commit your changes to your forked copy.
  - Put in a `pull request`, and see your changes get merged into the master branch.
